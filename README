Build procedure
- cd /path/to/istatserver

A default passcode is generated on install. It can be found in the preference file, which is generally located at /usr/local/etc/istatserver/istatserver.conf. iStat for iOS and iStat for macOS will ask for this passcode the first time you connect to your computer.

Example boot scripts for rc.d, upstart and system are located inside the resources folder. You may need to customize these depending on your OS
